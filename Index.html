    <h2>About Climate Change</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Climate change refers to the long-term alterations in Earth's climate patterns, including temperature, precipitation, and wind.</li>
        <li>It is caused by human activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.</li>
        <li>It is also leading to the <u>loss of biodiversity</u>, as ecosystems struggle to adapt to changing conditions and <u>species are forced to migrate or go extinct</u>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why should we prevent Climate Change?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Climate change is causing irreversible damage to our planet,including rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters.</li>
        <li>It is also contributing to the spread of diseases, poor air quality, and extreme weather events that threaten human health and wellbeing.</li>
        <li>Preventing it can lead to increased energy efficiency and decreased energy consumption, saving money and reducing emissions.</li>
        <li>By preventing climate change, we can ensure that future generations inherit a sustainable and livable planet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Effects on plants and animals due to Natural disasters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Habitat destruction: Natural disasters such as wildfires,hurricanes can destroy or damage plant and animal habitats</li>
        <li>Displacement and migration: When natural disasters occur, animals may be forced to flee their habitats and seek new areas for food, and shelter.    </li>
        <li>Species loss: Natural disasters can also lead to the loss of plant and animal species. For example, wildfires can destroy entire ecosystems and cause the loss of endangered species.</li>
        <li>Soil erosion: Floods and other natural disasters can cause soil erosion, which can lead to loss of nutrients in the soil and decreased plant growth.</li>
    </ul>
